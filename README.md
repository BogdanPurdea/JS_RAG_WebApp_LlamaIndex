## Documentation for JavaScript RAG Application Using LlamaIndex

### Overview

This is a JavaScript RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application using LlamaIndex. The application leverages OpenAI's API for language generation and retrieval functionalities.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed (version 14.x or higher)
- npm (Node package manager)
- An OpenAI API key

### Project Setup

 **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Setting Up the `.env` File

1. **Create a `.env` File**:
   In the root directory of your project, create a file named `.env`.

2. **Add Your OpenAI API Key**:
   Open the `.env` file in a text editor and add the following line, replacing `your-openai-api-key` with your actual OpenAI API key:

   ```plaintext
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
   ```
2. **Expected Output**:
   The console should display the response generated by the OpenAI API based on the given prompt.

### Conclusion

You have successfully set up and run a JavaScript RAG application using LlamaIndex and the OpenAI API. Modify the `index.js` file to test with different prompts or integrate more complex functionalities as needed. For further information on using the OpenAI API, refer to the [OpenAI API documentation](https://beta.openai.com/docs/).
